# simplePrintingPythonCode

This is just a little bit of Python automation coding that I created to print digital certificates.
I get the csv file with the names of the students and the pdf version of all the certificates.
The code is just to save a PDF file named after the course and the student for each certificate.

To run, just open the pdf file before pressing the ok button on the first window that'll appear.

ps. for obvious reasons, the csv and pdf files are stripped of information about the certificates and used here just for an example of how the code works.

Using:
- python as language
- pyautogui for automation
- pandas for reading csv file
- numpy arrays to try and make it a lighter code than using dataframe inside the loop
